## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3 and pip – Python package installer.
- Virtualenv – For creating isolated Python environments. Install with:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

- libcanberra-gtk-module – For playing notification sounds (Linux only):
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
```
## Installation
##### Download and Navigate to Project Directory
Clone or download the project files from the repository. Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your_project_directory
```

##### Run Setup Script

Run the `setup.sh` script to automatically set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and create a desktop shortcut.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

##### Manual Installation (Optional)

If you prefer manual setup, follow these steps:
1. Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a Desktop Shortcut (optional for dock access):

Create a .desktop file (instructions in the Shortcut and Dock Access section below).

## Running Worklock

Once installed, you can run Worklock in a few ways:
- From Applications Menu: Search for "Worklock" in your applications menu. Click to launch.
- From Dock: If you've pinned it to your dock, click to open.
- From Terminal:
```bash
    cd /path/to/your_project_directory
    source venv/bin/activate
    python worklock.py
```
## Shortcut and Dock Access
##### Creating a Desktop Shortcut Manually

If the setup script didn’t create a shortcut or you need to set it up manually:

1. Open a new file in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/Worklock.desktop
```
2. Add the following content:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Worklock
Comment=Track work and break sessions with notifications
Exec=/path/to/your_project_directory/venv/bin/python /path/to/your_project_directory/worklock.py
Icon=/path/to/your_project_directory/icon.png  # Optional
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
```
3. Make Executable:
```bash
    chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/Worklock.desktop
```

4. Pin to Dock: Open Worklock from the applications menu and pin it to your dock by right-clicking and selecting "Add to Favorites."

## Uninstallation

To uninstall Worklock:
- Remove the Project Directory:

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/your_project_directory
```
- Remove the Desktop Shortcut:
```bash
rm ~/.local/share/applications/Worklock
```
- Delete any Logs or Configurations (optional): Remove any log files or configurations generated by Worklock.

## Troubleshooting
##### Notifications or Sound Not Working

Ensure `libcanberra-gtk-module` is installed for sound notifications:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
```
##### Shortcut Not Showing in Applications Menu
If you don’t see Worklock in the applications menu, try refreshing the desktop database:

```bash
xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate
```
##### Fun Fact Not Displaying
The fun fact feature requires internet access. Ensure your internet connection is active when starting a break session.
